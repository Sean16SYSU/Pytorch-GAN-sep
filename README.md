# Pytorch-GAN-sep
Some GAN-related papers are implemented separately in this repository. The codes are split into different modules such as "model.py",  "main.py", "dataloader.py" or "judge.py".  In this way, the codes is longer but easier to transfer to other GANs models or applied for your own purpose.
